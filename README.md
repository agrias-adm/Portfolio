## üßë‚Äçüíª LLM Chat Interface

- **Integration:** Frontend sends messages to `POST /api/chat`.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI server uses Groq client when `GROQ_API_KEY` is set; otherwise returns demo responses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Local Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
